Overview
--------
restool is a user space application providing the ability to dynamically
create and manage DPAA2 containers and objects from Linux.

Prerequisites
-------------
restool interacts with the DPAA2 Management Complex (MC).  It uses an ioctl to
send MC commands, and thus requires a Linux kernel driver providing the needed
ioctl support.

Building
--------
restool is designed for use with ARMv8 SoCs and has been tested with ARMv8
cross and native compilers.

   # cross-build
   export CROSS_COMPILE=[name-of-cross-compiler]
   make

   # native build
   make

   # building big-endian
   make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-mbig-endian

Installing
----------
The command:
   make install

...will install restool into $DESTDIR/sbin and the scripts into
$DESTDIR/usr/bin.

Getting Help
------------
restool has complete built-in help, including examples.

  -to see global help, including all objects supported:
      restool --help

  -to see the commands available for a given object:
      restool [object] help
      (e.g. restool dpni help)

  -to see the help for a specific object/command combination:
      restool [object] [command] --help
      (e.g. restool dpni create --help)

Scripts
-------
The ./scripts directory contains a set of wrapper scripts that can
be used to perform complicated operations that could take a number
of restool invocations:
   ls-addni   # adds a network interface
   ls-addmux  # adds a dpdmux
   ls-addsw   # adds an l2switch
   ls-listmac # lists MACs and their connections
   ls-listni  # lists network interfaces and their connections
